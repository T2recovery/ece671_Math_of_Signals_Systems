    "High level explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier series was initiaally created to provide a solution to the heat equation. Joseph Fourier found that he could solve this by superimposing sinusoids on top of one another. This superposition is know as the Fourier Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "In math, the Fourier series is a peridodic function made up of sinusoids. These sinusoids can also be thought of as rotating vectors in the imaginary plane. When these sinusoids, or vectors are summed and weighted, they can be used to represent other signals and provide solutions to otherwise difficult functions. \n"
