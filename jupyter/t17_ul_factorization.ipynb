    "It is a modified form of Gaussian elimination. While the Cholesky decomposition only works for symmetric, positive definite matrices, the more general LU factorization works for any square matrix.In numerical analysis and linear algebra LU factorization factors a matrix as the product of lower triangular matrix and the upper triangular matrix which is also known as lower-upper factorization. Permutation matrix can be included with the product. LU factorization can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination. In this project I will present SciPy listing as well as pure Python listing for LU Factorization. I will use linear equations to formulate a matrix equation, involving the matrix A and the vector x and b of which x is to be determined. \n",

    "I will make use of the Doolittles LUP factorization with partial pivoting to factorize my matrix A into $PA=LU$, where L is a lower triangular matrix, U is an upper triangular matrix and P is a permutation matrix. \n",

    " \n",
    "The simpiest and most efficient way to create an LU decomposition in Python is to make use of the SciPy library which has a built in method to produce L, U and the permutation matrix P. \n",

This is not intended to be a fast implementation, in fact it will be significantly slower than the SciPy variant outlined above.

If the matrix itself is complex, so that we want to solve the system $(A + iC) â€¢ (x + iy)=(b + id)$ then there are two possible ways to proceed. The best way is to rewrite ludcmp and lubksb as complex routines. Complex modulus substitutes for absolute value in the construction of the scaling vector vv and in the search for the largest pivot elements. Everything else goes through in the obvious way, with complex arithmetic used as needed. "
