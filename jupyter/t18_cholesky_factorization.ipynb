    "##  Introduction\n",
    "The factorization is named after Andre-Louis Cholesky, a French military officer involved in geodetics engineering. Andre-Louis Cholesky lived from 1875 to 1918, killed in World War I (WWI). He attented the renowned university Ã‰cole Polytechnique in France, where the first discoveries about radioactivity occurred. Cholesky survyed Crete and North Africa before WWI. Before the war Cholesky created and used the Cholesky decomposition in his survying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cholesky decomposition is the decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose, which is useful for efficient numerical solutions, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations and systems with multiple correlated variables (a system with independant variables would result in matrices that are not Hermitian, positive-deffinite and thus non solvable with this method). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Cholesky decomposition is also closely related to the solution of least-squares problems, since the normal equations that characterize the least-squares solution have a symmetric positive-definite coefficient matrix. When it is applicable, the Cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as efficient as the LU decomposition for solving systems of linear equations. It can also be used to calculate and use correlation matrices in experiment statistics. In the case of a scalar (n = 1), the Cholesky factor $ R $ is just the positive square root of $ A $. However, $ R $ should not be confused with the square roots of $ A $."

    "## Explanation of the theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cholesky factorization can be thought of, with caution (see above), as finding the general square root of matrix $ A $. Using this type of factorization, we factor $ A $ into a single matrix $ L $ multiplied by itself $ A=L L^{T} $ or $ A=R^{T} R $. In the case of a scalar (n = 1), the Cholesky factor $ R $ is just the positive square root of $ A $. However, $ R $ should not be confused with the square roots of $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every positive definite matrix $ A $ has a Cholesky factorization if there exists a lower trianglar matrix $ L $ that contains positive diagonal elements such that $ A=L L^{T} $. In summary, Cholesky factorization is a specific form of LU decomposition where $ U=L^{T} $. This fact makes computing $ L $ much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Theorem :__ Every positive definite matrix $ A $ has a Cholesky factorization which may be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof:_ Using induction on an $ n-1 \\space \\times \\space n-1 $ matrix, we can prove the result for the trivial $ 1 \\space \\times \\space 1 $ positive definite matrix $ A $ and extend it to an $ n \\space \\times \\space n $ matrix. For the $ 1 \\space \\times \\space 1 $ positive definite matrix $ A = [a_{11}] $, $ a_{11} > 0 $. Therefore $ L=[l_{11}] $ where $ l_{11}=sqrt(a_{11}) $. This result then can be extended to any positive definite matrix $ A $.\n",

    " \n",
    " Since $ A $ is positive definite, $ a_{11} > 0 $, and thus we can easily determine that $ l_{11} = \\sqrt{a_{11}} $ and $ L_{21} = \\frac{1}{l_{11}} \\space A_{21} $.\n",

    "__Use in linear algebra__\n",
    "To solve linear systems of equations, Cholesky factorization can be used when computing $ A^{-1} $ is difficult or computationally expensive - as is the case for large systems. To solve equations in $ Ax=b $ form, we only have to perform one intermediate step before solving for $ \\textbf{x} $. This comes from the fact that once $ A $ is factored into $ L L^{T} $ we can redefine the equation with a temporary vector $ \\textbf{y} $ \n",

    "\n",
    "Then, having found $ \\textbf{y} $, the next step is use backward substitution to solve for $ \\textbf{x} $ in\n",

    "\n",
    "Both forward substitution and backward substitution can be performed by directly solving each equation in the system sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the Cholesky factorization could also be written as $ A=U^{H} U $.  Where $ U $ = $ L^{H} $. Here $ U $ is an upper triangle matrix instead of a lower triangle matrix. This could be useful if a solver for an upper triangle has already been implemented then the order of the matrix can change my taking the Hermitian of the L matrix. \n",
